I hope to live in a world where a greater percentage of people have the opportunity to pursue their passions, and where a greater percentage of people are passionate about public goods. My favorite part about being active in the open-source public goods technology industry is the quality of people with whom I get to form relationships, and how fulfilling it is to share a purpose with such a diverse range of individuals.
