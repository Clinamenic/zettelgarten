#r/JK/GT/Q/unresolved  I don't understand the mathematical logic or theoretical implications of this passage.

[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#^5c8f31]]

> Moreover, if the output of an industry is a function $Φ(N_r)$ of the labour employed in it, we have
$$\frac{1 - e_{or}}{e_{er}} = - \frac{N_rΦ''(N_r)}{p_{wr}(Φ'(N_r))^2}$$
  where $p_{wr}$ is the expected price of a unit of output in terms of the wage-unit. Thus the condition $e_{or} = 1$ means that $Φ''(N_r) = 0$, i.e. that there are constant returns in response to increased employment.
