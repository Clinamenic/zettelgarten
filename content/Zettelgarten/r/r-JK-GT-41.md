In section 12.2, Keynes introduces how the long-term expectations informing prospective yield depend not only on our leading forecasts but also on their degree or level of confidence. He also says that this factor, the level of confidence, is often neglected by economists and ought to be understood *a posteriori*, based on observation of actual economic and entrepreneurial phenomena, rather than *a priori*, based on pure reasoning.
