Many of the ideals of the semantic web are global and universal in character. The ontologies involved are often broad enough, by design, to enable a field of applications beyond what the designers themselves can envision. But what about the applications they can envision, the applications they encounter in their own lives and communities, and with which they are intimately familiar?

The ambitions and imperatives of universal ontologies don't necessarily come at the expense of a cozier product-community fit, but they often can overwhelm said communities with technical friction and complexity. If a given community has a well-defined sensemaking need, which a given ontology can meaningfully address, to what extent should that ontology be stretched or generalized to accommodate a broader audience, at the risk of jeopardizing the initial product-community fit?

This article will explore the ontological implications of community-first technical solutions, in the spirit of [home-cooked software](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software). This broader inquiry will focus on the example of a peer-to-peer publication network and knowledge commons.

## Example: A Civic Knowledge Commons

To ground this article in the actual activities of an actual community, I will highlight some of the work being done in a particular consortium of civic technologists and community organizers. Much of our collective research interest lately has been around civic protocols, or organizing patterns which can enables communities to self-organize and fulfill civic purposes. In the interest of surfacing, circulating, and refining best practices, we are building a knowledge commons for relevant resources.

In more concrete terms, this involves creating and collating resources with appropriately open licenses, storing and mirroring them in locations which are accessible to members of our global community, and promoting them in situations where we think they would be useful. While we are planning on including resources of all kinds and formats, we are focusing somewhat on markdown files as a widely adopted vehicle for the sort of knowledge we'd like to proliferate.

Here is where the question of ontology enters the picture. Do we need a standard for frontmatter properties, or should we at least promote certain conventions? Its quite easy, especially for a communities of nerds, to get lost in the technical details, and lose the forest for the trees. That is, in putting too much emphasis on sufficiently interoperable technical standards, we run the risk of losing touch with what our community finds valuable.

But are local optima always at odds with global optima? Perhaps not necessarily, but in some ways they usually are. The point here is not to sketch ultimatum between local and global, but to rather to hint at a particular design philosophy: designing for community first, and the rest of the world second (if at all).

## Graduated Target Audience

Optimizing for global applicability may result in a solution which caters to the lowest common denominator across a number of communities, as a result of triaging demands across a number of addressable market. Optimizing for local applicability, on the other hand, may result in an application which is overfit to that local community and unsuited for more global application.

One way to reframe the apparent conflict between local applicability and global applicability, is a tiered or graduated approach to design. This approach places the local first, and only "graduates" to accommodate the global in manners which don't come at the expense of the local.
