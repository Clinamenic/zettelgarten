### 08/10 Active Inference Applied to Organization Design

The cognitive-agentic model of active inference may be applied to individual organisms and collective organizations alike, with the media of sustenance being energy/calories for the former and funding for the latter

### 08/17 Alphanumeric Alternative-Base Ordering System

Use the alphanumeric alternative-base system for assigning IDs to notes, where every degree removed from the primary integer (1, 2, 3, etc) "string" denotes some offshoot or derivative topic. For example, if Note 1 is a note about knowledge management, and all of its first degree notes (1A, 1B, 1C, etc) will also be about knowledge management. Or, if Note 7 is a note taken from Hayek's Constitution of Liberty, then Note 7's first degree string (7A, 7B, 7C, etc) will also be notes from that book. ^555581

### 08/17 Top-Level String

The top-level or primary string of the zettelkasten is a catch-all container for any sort of note, whereas child strings have increasing measures of focus according to their degree of removal from the top-level string. ^29f8af

### 08/21 Untitled

In circumstances where efforts are being made to steer a status quo toward some more ideal state, there may arise a dissonance between the reality of the situation and the representation of the situation, i.e. how the situation is depicted or described. Here, two broad courses of action can be followed, if the dissonance is to be resolved: either conform the reality to the representation, or the representation to the reality. In situations where the representation is closer to the ideal than the reality, the former approach may sometimes serve as a forcing function for the reality to conform to said ideals, rather than capitulating and conforming the representation to the reality, such as it is.

### 08/23 Nucleation of Cores within Exstitutions

In the course of a given field of operations, an exstitution may identify the need to sustain one or more operational cores, or "poles" insofar as the internal and external activity of the exstitution may revolve around these cores.

### 08/25 Information Symmetry Across Institutional Membranes

Given an organizational context of institutional cores embedded in extitutional networks, information may prove asymmetrical across the membranes of these institutional cores.

### 09/09 Ideonomic Bricolage

Ideonomic bricolage is the practice of constructing ideas into assemblages, for discursive, aesthetic, or other purposes. The term 'ideonomy' is here used in the sense meaning a systematic and analytic treatment of ideas.
