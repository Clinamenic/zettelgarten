In section 15.4, Keynes briefly compares his models of liquidity-preference (in the aggregate) to the Quantity Theory of Money, and how, in a "static" society where there is certainty regarding future interest rates, $M_2$ would come to zero, i.e. the propensity to hoard would diminish, because the liquidity of holding cash is largely (at least in $M_2$) to protect or hedge against uncertainty of future interest rates.
