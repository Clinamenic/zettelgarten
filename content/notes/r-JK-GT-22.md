Here Keynes frames the firm as the form of intelligence, establishing expectations, procuring employees and capital equipment, receiving returns, and adjusting expectations. He also says, here, that the expectations are more of a causal/fundamental influence, with respect to employment and output, than "actually realized" results/proceeds are.
