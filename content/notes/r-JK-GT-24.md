Reflection 2: It occurs to me now that I may have been misunderstanding the aggregate supple function and aggregate demand function. I thought the ASF was the amount entrepreneurs were expecting to make, and the ADF was the amount that consumers were willing to pay. It seems, according to me current understanding, rather that the ASF is the actual price paid by the entrepreneur for a given volume of employment, and ADF is the amount they expect to receive from outputs.
