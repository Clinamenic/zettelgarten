In Chapter 6, Keynes attempts to establish a canonical definition of income, saving, and interest, consistent with his theory of effective demand, as distinguished from classical theories of employment and value which assume a more fixed relationship between supply and demand. Here, Keynes defines income as the entrepreneur's proceeds ($A$), minus the user cost ($U$) incurred over a given period of production. He defines net income as proceeds minus user cost, minus supplementary cost ($V$), or the excess of expected depreciation of capital equipment beyond user cost. 

#r/JK/GT/Q/unresolved Keynes also offers canonical definitions of saving and investment, as derived from the definition of income. He also equates saving and investment, but I don't quite understand how (see [[r-JK-GT-25.1]]).
