In section 8.1, Keynes introduces the 'propensity to consume' as a functional relationship between a given level of income in terms of the wage-unit ($Y_w$) and the amount of that income spent on consumption, also measured in terms of the wage-unit ($C_w$), such that:
$$C_w = χ(Y_w)$$
Here, the level of actual consumption is distinct from $D_1$, the expected level of consumption estimated by the entrepreneur, as part of the entrepreneur's expected proceeds $D = D_1 + D_2$. In this sense, $D_1$ is an approximation or expectation of $C$. He also argues that the propensity to consume can be adequately understood in terms of subjective factors and objective factors.
