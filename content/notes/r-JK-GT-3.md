Here, Keynes points out that the classical theories of value and production assume that real wages, in a sufficiently free/competitive market, tend to equilibrate to offset marginal disutility of labor, but that there is still an implicit conflation between real wages and money wages. Given that bargaining between entrepreneurs and laborers is usually expressed in terms of money wages, rather than in terms of the real purchasing power of wages, it is perhaps safer to assume that money wages nominally tend to equilibrate to offset marginal disultility of labor.
