In Chapter 4, Keynes argues that it is more prudent to use two units of account, wage units and labor units, to quantitatively evaluate the supply side and demand side, respectively. He argues that there are tradeoffs between this choice of units versus a more heterogeneous approach, but that ultimately this two-unit approach effectively simplifies these analyses within an acceptable range of fuzziness.
