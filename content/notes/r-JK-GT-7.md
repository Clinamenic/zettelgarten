Here Keynes points out that, in certain respects. the collective unconscious agency of labor may be more prudent than the conscious analytic attempts of economists, at least those of the classical school, in terms of acting in the interest of labor, namely by resisting decreases in real wages below the marginal disutility of labor.

[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#^172d94]]

> Thus it is fortunate that the workers, though unconsciously, are instinctively more reasonable economists than the classical school, inasmuch as they resist reductions of money-wages, which are seldom or never of an all-round character, even though the existing real equivalent of these wages exceeds the marginal disutility of the existing employment; whereas they do not resist reductions of real wages, which are associated with increases in aggregate employment and leave relative money-wages unchanged, unless the reduction proceeds so far as to threaten a reduction of the real wage below the marginal disutility of the existing volume of employment. Every trade union will put up some resistance to a cut in money-wages, however small. But since no trade union would dream of striking on every occasion of a rise in the cost of living, they do not raise the obstacle to any increase in aggregate employment which is attributed to them by the classical school.
