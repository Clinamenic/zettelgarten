Re: [[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#Chapter 8, Section III]]

In section 8.3, Keynes argues that, in general consumption rises as income rises, but that the former ($ΔC_w$) rises at a slower rate than the latter ($ΔY_w$), such that $dC_w/dY_w$ is generally less than 1 ($C$ and $Y$ here are measured in wage-units). He largely attributes this to individual economic psychology, but that this consumptive spending doesn't rise in a fixed proportion to increasing income, but rather leaves a cap which needs to be filled by increased investment.
