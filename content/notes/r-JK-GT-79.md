In section 21.1, Keynes states that the prevailing discourse of the classical theory has experienced difficulty reconciling a theory of value (e.g. supply and demand) with a theory of prices (i.e. money), and that there could be more optimal distinctions to draw between prominent economic theories. He suggests a split between microeconomic and macroeconomic theories of output, and states that the importance of money s due to its role as a link between present and future economic states.
