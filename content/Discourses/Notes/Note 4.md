## Parallel Drafting

By working on multiple manuscripts at a time ("Parallel Drafting") within the slip-box system, the surface area for "live" meaningful association can increase. In other words, as one navigates and re-encounters ideas in the slip-box, the likelihood of these encounters being relevant increases if one is actively developing multiple manuscripts. ^3512b4
