## Archiving Unused Notes

One technique to employ when drafting and revising a piece of writing, is to move sections of it into a a document instead of deleting them, in case they later prove to be of value. This may enable one to identify sections and ideas which do not organically fit within an argument, but without the pressure of deciding to erase them. ^85bc38
