The following research was conducted for [LexDAO](https://lexdao.org/) by Spencer Saar Cavanaugh of [Clinamenic LLC](https://www.clinamenic.com/). Funding for this research was provided by the [Hypercerts Foundation](https://hypercerts.org/docs/about/).
## Abstract

The field of legal engineering is an applied field within computational law, and has seen a variety of innovative and experimental mechanisms developed to bridge legal systems with technologies like blockchain, specifically in the latter's capacity as a peer-to-peer virtual machine and financial settlement layer. Viewed through the lens of law as a public good, the field of legal engineering has the potential to democratize and streamline a variety of legal processes, such as blockchain-based ("onchain") reporting and compliance, onchain entity formation, and the facilitation of contracts. While this industry has already seen a number of exciting products and services developed, such as [multisignature accounts](https://safe.global/) and [legal wrappers](https://www.wrappr.wtf/), there remains a systematic need for mapping and evaluating the work being done. The establishment and promotion of an evaluative methodology for legal engineering products and services, geared around the fundamental nature of such products and services as capture-resistant and permissionless public goods, can help ensure that such innovation remains accessible and interoperable as institutional adoption increases and regulatory regimes develop. 

## Introduction

This prospectus is concerned with outlining some initial practices around how legal engineering projects can be evaluated on the basis of the impact they have as public goods. Specifically, this research will be exploring how certain protocols, such as [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) and [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/), can be used for such impact evaluation. However, while much of the conversation around blockchain public goods has been geared around assessing impact as it is made, this research concerns how legal engineering products and services can be evaluated on the basis of potential impact. More specifically, this research concerns the development of an analytic methodology whereby legal engineering products and services can be evaluated on the basis of certain public goods criteria. Not every legal engineering product or service need be oriented around such an evaluative paradigm, but this prospectus is focused on those products and services which constitute public goods and which embody this notion of law as a public good. 

Before any methodological considerations, we will first address the manner in which these protocols can be understood as public goods. We will then examine the basic mechanisms underpinning Hypercerts and Ethereum Attestation Service, seeing as these two protocols, themselves constituting public goods, may be used in conjunction with one another in the assessment of public goods in general. 

### Open Source Software as a Public Good


### Hypercerts

Hypercerts are onchain certificates designed to facilitate the assessment and funding of public goods. Someone working on a public good can mint a hypercert, specify the work they are doing, and sell a number of these hypercerts to funders who want to support public goods. This last step can also be understood as issuing a donation receipt to funders of public goods. 

Like other protocols in the blockchain public goods space, hypercerts were designed with the intention of supporting an ecosystem. That is, they are configured to be interoperable within a network of developers, funders and beneficiaries revolving around public goods, all of whom having their own information to share and seek. People building public goods need to convey the work they are doing and the impact it is having, in order to receive funding. People funding public goods want to see evidence of the impactful work being done, in order to feel confident that their donations are being effectively allocated.
